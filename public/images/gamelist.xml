    <desc>Introducing a more lethal and cunningly efficient Bond, the game blends intense first-person action with a unique third-person cover combat system that allows players to truly feel what it is like to be the ultimate secret agent as they use their stealth, precision shooting and lethal combat skills to progress through missions. Blending the action of the &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; feature film with the &quot;Casino Royale&quot; movie, the title propels players into the cinematic experience of international espionage. Based on the Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare game engine that has been specifically engineered to immerse players in the Bond universe, the Quantum of Solace game delivers high-definition graphics, reactive AI and visually stunning locations inspired by locales portrayed in the films. Quantum of Solace marks the first time players can become the dangerous and cunning Bond as portrayed by Daniel Craig. From silent take downs and sneaking through confined spaces, to one-on-one shoot outs and large scale battles, players experience a variety of gameplay that challenges them to think through situations and choose how they progress, whether it&apos;s through covert means or confronting enemies in full force. Advanced combat and Realistic AI: Players engage in both first-person and third-person gameplay that allows gamers to be Bond in unscripted battles against the world&apos;s most evil villains and mercenaries. Filled with armed combat, massive explosions and vertigo-inducing chases, gamers are immersed in an authentic Bond universe and drawn into epic movie moments with theatrical camera angles, split screen effects, picture-in-picture sequences, and amazing environments inspired by real world locations such as Montenegro, Venice, Bolivia and Austria. Bringing James Bond to next-gen consoles for the first time, gamers now have the ability to battle online in a variety of modes.</desc>

    <desc>In Air Conflicts: Secret Wars players can relive the most famous battles of the First and Second World War right up close. The game provides plenty of variety, as players can fly 16 meticulously detailed and accurate aircraft in nearly 50 exciting missions in the seven campaigns. The mission tasks are diverse and range from air space clearance operations to the bombardment of targets on the ground, attacks on enemy convoys and reconnaissance, escort and patrol flights. After each successful mission players can upgrade their skills to enable them to control their aircraft more expertly, make their aircraft more robust and select better co-pilots. There are two control modes for the combat aircraft: the controls are simplified in arcade mode and simulation mode offers a realistic control system that is true to the original. Besides the solo campaigns, Air Conflicts: Secret Wars can also offer several multiplayer modes for up to eight players that can be played on a local network and over the Internet.</desc>

    <desc>Billed as an &quot;espionage RPG,&quot; Alpha Protocol casts you in the role of secret agent Michael Thorton as he embarks on a series of international operations set in Rome, Moscow, Tai Pei, Saudi Arabia, and other exotic locales. From inside computer-equipped safe houses around the world, you&apos;ll converse with your handlers, glean intelligence, review dossiers, and receive new missions. What sets Alpha Protocol apart from traditional action games is the level of customization you have over your character and the options you have while interacting with others. Key role-playing features like dialogue trees, skill points, and equipment upgrades are included, with characters who will react in different ways based on your approach and reputation.

The action takes place from a third-person perspective as you complete objectives however you see fit, depending on the direction of your character. Stealth-oriented spies can complete the entire game without killing an enemy, while destructive types can bring out the body armor and heavy artillery. Action points can be assigned to an assortment of attributes, from stealth and pistols to sabotage and technical aptitude, which all lead to different skills. Cash earned by completing missions can also be spent in multiple ways, from powerful weapons on the black market to hiring mercenaries to purchasing various gun modifications for improving stats in areas like damage, accuracy, recoil, stability, and ammunition capacity.</desc>

    <desc>Amplitude features over 20 songs composed for an optimal beatmatching experience by Harmonix with contributions from Freezepop, Danny B, Jim Guthrie, and more. Many of the developers from the original game are actively working on the reboot. The new Amplitude will be treated like a classic, sci-fi concept album. There is a narrative that runs through the game and surfaces in many ways through the visuals, music and song lyrics. Players will speed down long, winding paths made up of the different musical elements of a song. Each track is differentiated with the musical sounds of synthesizers, drums, vocals, and bass. As players blast away the patterns of gems on these tracks, they release musical energy and recreate the hidden song within. Gameplay remains easy to pick up and difficult to master. Achieving a top score will be a challenge and therefore worth bragging about via online leaderboards. Amplitude supports up to four players locally. Challenge your friends and use devastating power-ups during frenetic multiplayer matches to secure your place at the top.</desc>

    <desc>The actual story mode of the game can be compared to an adventure game. The main - unnamed - character is a journalist, in search of the missing oceanographer William &quot;Bill&quot; Graber. Using a submarine called the Dolphin no.2 you explore the seas for clues.

The game takes place in Kisira Atoll, in Polynesia. An oceanographic research facility named Kisira Base is the starting point and where you always come back to, for supplies (such as batteries for sonar navigation buoys) and equipment.

Two scientists work at the base, the young and dreamy Jessica Porter and the conservative chief Robert Kemelman. Both assist you in solving mysteries, each in their own way. Jessica likes to believe fairytales and legends, while Robert usually comes up with a scientific explanation.

All the fish, animals and other discoveries are added to a database. Some fish can communicate and the player has to repeat the sounds made by a fish, using the four trigger buttons of the Sixaxis controller.

At all times, the unlocked area of the map is free to explore as you like.</desc>

    <desc>The game follows the titular character, the demigod Asura as he seeks revenge on the other pantheon of demigods who betrayed him. The story is presented in the style and format of an episodic series of cinematic shorts, including opening and closing credits, with the gameplay being integrated into the cinematic where players switch between third-person combat and interactive sequences with player input in the form of quick-time even button prompts. Because of its unique style, the game has been decribed in the media as an &quot;interactive anime&quot;. According to the game&apos;s producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya, &quot;Asura&apos;s Wrath takes elements from Hinduism and Buddhism and blends them with science fiction, with the main and supporting characters based on the ever combative and superiority-seeking beings of the same name that are part of the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology.</desc>

    <desc>Batman: Arkham Asylum is a 2009 action-adventure video game based on the DC Comics superhero Batman. It was developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Eidos Interactive in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows. It was released worldwide for consoles, beginning in North America on August 25, 2009, with a Microsoft Windows version following on September 15.

Written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini, Arkham Asylum is based on the long-running comic book mythos. In the game&apos;s main storyline, Batman&apos;s archenemy, the Joker, instigates an elaborate plot to seize control of Arkham Asylum and trap Batman inside with many of his incarcerated foes. With Joker threatening to detonate hidden bombs around fictional Gotham City, Batman is forced to fight his way through the asylum&apos;s inmates and put an end to the Joker&apos;s plans. Most of the game&apos;s leading characters are voiced by actors who have appeared in other media based on the DC Animated Universe; Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin reprised their roles as Batman, the Joker, and his sidekick Harley Quinn respectively. The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman&apos;s combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in combat and exploration.

The game received critical acclaim—particularly for its narrative—and won several awards, including Best Action Adventure game, Best Game, and Game of the Year from different media outlets. It held the Guinness World Record for &quot;Most Critically Acclaimed Superhero Game Ever&quot;. A Game of the Year edition was released on March 26, 2010, and an OS X version was released in November 2011. Arkham Asylum &apos;​s success launched a series of Batman: Arkham sequels, beginning in October 2011 with Batman: Arkham City.</desc>

    <desc>The Beatles: Rock Band is a 2009 music video game developed by Harmonix, published by MTV Games, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It is the third major console release in the Rock Band music video game series, in which players can simulate the playing of rock music by using controllers shaped like musical instruments. The Beatles: Rock Band is the first band-centric game in the series, and it is centered on the popular English rock group the Beatles. The game features virtual portrayals of the four band members performing the songs throughout the band&apos;s history, including depictions of some of their famous live performances, as well as a number of &quot;dreamscape&quot; sequences for songs from the Abbey Road Studios recording sessions during the group&apos;s studio years. The game&apos;s soundtrack consists of 45 Beatles songs; additional songs and albums by the Beatles were made available for the game as downloadable content.[1]

The game was released internationally on 9 September 2009, coinciding with the release of new, remastered compact disc versions of the Beatles&apos; albums. It incorporates many of the gameplay features of the Rock Band series; however, it is not an expansion pack for the Rock Band series and content for it and other Rock Band titles is not cross-compatible. Harmonix co-founder Alex Rigopulos described the game as &quot;... a new, full game title production built from the ground up.&quot;[2] Gameplay mechanics differ slightly from previous Rock Band games, including the addition of a three-part vocal harmony system. Subsequent games in the Rock Band series would reuse these new elements, including vocal harmonies.

The game was developed with the blessing and critical input of Apple Corps, including former Beatles Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, who both made public appearances supporting the game. George Harrison&apos;s son Dhani helped to bridge discussion between Harmonix and Apple Corps, while Giles Martin, son of the Beatles&apos; music producer George Martin, ensured high-fidelity versions of the Beatles&apos; songs would be available.

The Beatles: Rock Band was well received by the press, both as a genuine means of experiencing the music and history of the Beatles and as a standalone music video game. Although the game&apos;s sales were considered respectable, with more than half a million units sold during its first month of release in the United States, analysts had projected larger sales volumes and attributed the lower sales to waning interest in the rhythm game g</desc>

    <desc>Beyond Good &amp; Evil is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft and released in late 2003 for the PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, Xbox and GameCube platforms. A full HD re-mastered version of the game was released on Xbox Live Arcade in March 2011 and on PlayStation Network in June 2011. The story follows the adventures of Jade, an investigative reporter and martial artist, who works with a resistance movement to reveal a planet-wide alien conspiracy. The player controls Jade and allies, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and obtaining photographic evidence.

Michel Ancel, creator of the Rayman series, envisioned the game as the first part of a trilogy. Beyond Good &amp; Evil was a commercial failure, but was critically acclaimed, receiving a nomination for &quot;Game of the Year&quot; at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards. A sequel, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, is currently in development.[2]</desc>

    <desc>BioShock® Infinite is a first-person shooter like you’ve never seen. Just ask the judges from E3 2011, where the Irrational Games title won over 75 editorial awards, including the Game Critics Awards’ Best of Show. Set in 1912, players assume the role of former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt, sent to the flying city of Columbia on a rescue mission. His target? Elizabeth, imprisoned since childhood. During their daring escape, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond -- one that lets Booker augment his own abilities with her world-altering control over the environment. Together, they fight from high-speed Sky-Lines, in the streets and houses of Columbia, on giant zeppelins, and in the clouds, all while learning to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities, and immersing players in a story that is not only steeped in profound thrills and surprises, but also invests its characters with what IGN called “Emotional ties (that) will continue to set the bar in gaming.”</desc>

Quickly, she learns this island isn&apos;t just trees, berries and gold - but something more sinister lies beneath the surface. As the wonderment of the island becomes to reveal itself, she learns this land can gift her powers man can only dream of, but also she&apos;s not alone on this island! Thank goodness she brought her own weapons. Ayumi then proceeds to battle against menacing villains on the island by destroying them and everything in her path while looking to acquire magical powers that only the strongest warrior can possess.</desc>

    <desc>The afterlife adventures of reluctant Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki make their high-def video game debut in the PlayStation 3-exclusive Bleach: Soul Resurrección. Gamers can role-play through re-creations of their favorite plotlines from the Bleach comics and cartoon series, or seek out new side-adventures in the freely roamed game world, stocked with random encounters and fan-friendly details. Cel-shaded graphics add interactive depth, in the anime&apos;s distinctive visual style. In addition to Ichigo, gamers may play through the mission-driven stories of 20 other characters from the popular manga and animated series. By choosing which new powers and abilities to unlock, characters can be custom-developed as they earn experience. The combat-centric action involves super-human swordplay and supernatural powers, and battles sometimes develop Dynasty Warriors-style odds, as the player&apos;s lone hero must aggressively fend through deluges of enemy opponents. The game&apos;s Mission Mode offers a goal-oriented alternative to the Story Mode&apos;s character-based campaigns.</desc>

    <desc>Brave is an adventure game adaptation based on the film of the same name developed by Behaviour Interactive and published by Disney Interactive Studios. Actress Kelly Macdonald, who voiced Mérida in the film, reprised her role for the video game. This game was originally going to be published by THQ, but was published by Disney Interactive Studios instead.

The gameplay consists of single player and local co-operative play.[2] The first player controls Mérida while in co-op mode a second player can take control of a will-o&apos;-the-wisp. Gameplay also features puzzles, which are to be solved with the help of the triplets, and Queen Elinor, who is playable in her bear form in arena fights. Different levels of the game can be accessed from the location called &quot;Ring of Stones&quot;. Players can use different types of charms (fire, earth, air, and ice) to add elemental effects to her arrows and sword attacks when fighting enemies, some of which are vulnerable to a certain element.

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game are compatible with the PlayStation Move and Kinect motion control peripherals, respectively. This feature comes in the form of an &quot;archery range&quot; m</desc>

    <desc>Players will become Captain America as he faces the Red Skull and his army in an epic third- person action adventure set in the darkest days of World War II.

Wielding Captain America&apos;s legendary shield, gamers will engage in free-flowing combat and acrobatic platforming to infiltrate Hydra&apos;s mysterious castle and battle the infamous Iron Cross, the forces of Hydra, and a host of nefarious enemies serving the Red Skull. As the First Avenger himself, players must defeat the evil scientist Arnim Zola and his wartime experiments, combining powerful melee combos and shield attacks to devastating effect.

Captain America: Super Soldier combines a highly athletic combat system with fluid platforming and a highly tuned suite of shield attacks, as Cap explores a massive castle turned military installation. His shield can be employed in numerous ways: taking out multiple enemies at once, deflecting incoming fire back at enemies, solving puzzles, and scaling walls. Players will be able to launch shield-first into the fray with the superior force of the world&apos;s first Super-Soldier at their fingertips—and they&apos;ll need every bit of that strength to overcome a castle that’s both an acrobatic playground for the Captain’s physical prowess and a house of mystery with enemies and danger at every turn.</desc>

    <desc>During the game, the player visits five islands, one of them the same island that Sonny will one day wash up on. It reuses some of the locations and characters from So Blonde: Back to the Island but it is not necessary to have played any of those games to understand the story. Travelling on the islands is instant through clicking on locations on an interactive map, between the islands by clicking on the ship in the docks. Progress is made by talking to people, solving puzzles and playing mini-games. The latter are entirely optional. The Nintendo DS version has no voice-overs but is otherwise identical to the other versions.</desc>

Lords of Shadow builds upon the combat systems first explored in this series in 2003&apos;s Lament of Innocence and adds more violent kills to the mix. Inspiration for these changes seems to have come from 2005&apos;s God of War.</desc>

    <desc>Child of Eden is a rhythm action game created by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, best known for Rez, developed by Q Entertainment and published by Ubisoft.The game announcement opened Ubisoft&apos;s pre-E3 2010 press conference and was one of the first titles shown with support for Xbox 360&apos;s Kinect peripheral. The game serves as a prequel to Mizuguchi&apos;s earlier game Rez and sees players shoot at various targets which produce melodic sounds upon destruction. It was developed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and is compatible with Microsoft&apos;s Kinect, PlayStation Move and standard controllers for both consoles.In April 2011, Mizuguchi announced that he had developed a unique corset peripheral for the game, which featured four controllers, all of which vibrated to the game&apos;s music. The new device is currently only available in Q Entertainment studios, and is unlikely to see a retail release.

As was the case with Rez, Child of Eden is presented as an experiment on synesthesia, integrating sound, vision and touch in one seamless experience. The game features music from Genki Rockets.</desc>

    <desc>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is based on the 2009 computer-animated film of the same name. The player is cast as Flint Lockwood, an aspiring inventor who tries to solve the hunger problem in his town by creating a machine that turns water into food. Soon, the machine is out of control, and it literally is raining food on Flint&apos;s town. It&apos;s up to him to stop the machine and get rid of the abundance of food. To make matters worse however, the machine is now protected by mutated food.

The player has to fight and puzzle their way through twenty levels, using Flint&apos;s self created gadgets such as a hair dryer converted into a heat gun, which can be used to melt obstacles composed of ice cream, or a mechanical boxing glove to punch food. Each level features thirty specific destroyable food items. Destroying all of them unlocks a piece of a blueprint for a special item.</desc>

    <desc>Dance Dance Revolution (ダンスダンスレボリューション Dansu Dansu Reboryūshon?), abbreviated DDR and also known as Dancing Stage in earlier games in Europe and Australasia, and some other games in Japan, is a music video game series produced by Konami. Introduced in Japan in 1998 as part of the Bemani series, and released in North America and Europe in 1999, Dance Dance Revolution is the pioneering series of the rhythm and dance genre in video games. Players stand on a &quot;dance platform&quot; or stage and hit colored arrows laid out in a cross with their feet to musical and visual cues. Players are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to choose more music to play to if they receive a passing score.

Dance Dance Revolution has been given much critical acclaim for its originality and stamina in the video game market. There have been dozens of arcade-based releases across several countries and hundreds of home video game console releases, promoting a music library of original songs produced by Konami&apos;s in-house artists and an eclectic set of licensed music from many different genres. The DDR series has inspired similar games such as Pump It Up by Andamiro and In the Groove by Roxor.</desc>

    <desc>King Allant the XII, the last king of Boletaria, searched tirelessly to expand his might. The Nexus, a great ice shrine nestled in the mountains, bestowed the power of the souls onto him, bringing prosperity to his kingdom. Still unsated, he returned again to the Nexus, where he foolishly awakened the Old One from its eternal slumber. This long forgotten evil, now wrought upon Boletaria, plunged the realm into darkness and fog. A mighty demon horde poured into the kingdom, devouring the souls of men. Champions from other realms learned of Boletaria&apos;s fate and sought to deliver the kingdom from evil; none would return from the cursed land. Called upon by a mysterious maiden in black, you go forth, the last hope for humanity in a place lost to demons and darkness...</desc>

    <desc>Epic Mickey 2 takes place in a world based on classic and retired Disney characters and attractions. The story begins sometime after the conclusion of the original Epic Mickey, with Oswald and the other Wasteland characters starting to rebuild their world. A series of earthquakes threaten to undo the work, but the Mad Doctor appears and convinces Oswald to join forces and combat the new menace. Ortensia, Oswald&apos;s girlfriend, doesn&apos;t trust the Doctor, so she and Gus, Oswald&apos;s gremlin assistant, bring Mickey Mouse back to Wasteland to help.
The gameplay in Epic Mickey 2 closely resembles that of the original. One of the biggest updates is the addition of Oswald as a supporting character for Mickey; Oswald can either be controlled by the computer or a second player. Oswald uses a remote control in the same basic method as Mickey uses his paintbrush, to attack or befriend enemy characters and to alter the environment as needed to complete tasks. Oswald also has many other abilities, such as flying with his ears, detaching his feet, and so on. There are also some special abilities that can only be used when Mickey and Oswald are working together.</desc>

    <desc>Doki-Doki Universe is a video game published and developed by HumaNature Studios for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita. The game is unique because it is essentially a large interactive personality test. The game starts with a robot named QT3 and a talking red balloon accidentally getting left on an asteroid by a human family traveling through space. Roughly forty years later Alien Jeff locates QT3 and informs him that his model is being discontinued for lacking humanity. Alien Jeff has been tasked with determining if QT3, an emotionless and obedient robot, is capable of learning humanity. Alien Jeff then takes QT3 and Balloon to a planet called home.</desc>

    <desc>Put on your sunglasses and prepare to step into the boots of Duke Nukem, whose legend has reached epic proportions in the years since his last adventure. The alien hordes are back and only Duke can save the world, again. Pig cops, alien shrink rays and enormous alien bosses won&apos;t stop our hero from accomplishing his one and only goal: to save the world, save the babes and to be a bad-ass while doing it.

The King of All Shooters is back with over-the-top weapons, massive aliens and unprecedented levels of interactivity. This game puts pedal to the metal and tongue firmly in cheek, among other places. Shoot hoops, lift weights, read adult magazines, draw crude messages on whiteboards or ogle one of the many beautiful women that populate Duke’s life; that is if you can pull yourself away long enough from kicking ass and taking names. Duke Nukem was and will forever be immortalized in gaming history, and this is his legend.</desc>

    <desc>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is an action-adventure platform video game developed by Ninja Theory and published by Namco Bandai Games. It was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 5, October 7 and October 8, 2010 in North America, Australia, Japan and Europe respectively.[1][2] A premium version, featuring all DLC content, was made for Microsoft Windows and Sony Playstation 3 and was later released on October 25, 2013.

The story is a re-imagining of the novel Journey to the West written by Wu Cheng&apos;en. Unlike the original story that was set in a fantastical version of ancient China, the game is set 150 years in a future post-apocalyptic world following a global war, with only remnants of humanity left, along with the still active war machines left over from the conflict. Like the original story however, the plot revolves around someone who forces the help and protection of a warrior, with many characters sharing the same names and roles. The game&apos;s story was written by Alex Garland, with voice talent and motion capture from Andy Serkis and Lindsey Shaw.</desc>

    <desc>The Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster, written as Final Fantasy X | X-2 HD Remaster in the official logo, is an upcoming remastered compilation of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. It was announced at the Sony Press Conference in Japan on September 14th, 2011 as part of a 10th anniversary special, and was released on December 26th, 2013 in Japan, and is scheduled to be released on March 2014 outside Japan. The compilation is based on the International version of both games.

It was initially announced that Square Enix&apos;s 1st Production Department would develop the port, but later it has been announced that the remaster was done by Virtuos Games.[7] Square Enix has a history of outsourcing remakes and ports to other companies, for example the DS remake of Final Fantasy III and Finest Fantasy for Advance, which were developed by Matrix Software and TOSE, respectively.

The two games will be available together on a single Blu-Ray disc for the PlayStation 3 version, and the Vita versions will not be sold individually as previously stated; instead, only Final Fantasy X will get a physical release, but it will include a download code for Final Fantasy X-2.[8] Yoshinori Kitase has confirmed that those who pick up both Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2 on PlayStation Vita will be able to take advantage of swapping saves between systems allowing fans to transfer data between the standalone Vita version and the PlayStation 3 counterpart.[</desc>

    <desc>Final Fight (Japanese: ファイナルファイト Hepburn: Fainaru Faito?) is a side-scrolling beat-&apos;em-up video game produced by Capcom. Originally released as an arcade game in 1989, it was the seventh title released for the CP System hardware. Set in the fictional Metro City, the player controls one of three characters: former pro wrestler and mayor Mike Haggar, his daughter&apos;s boyfriend Cody, and Cody&apos;s best friend Guy, as they set out to defeat the Mad Gear gang and rescue Haggar&apos;s young daughter Jessica.

The game began development as a sequel to the original Street Fighter released in 1987, but the genre was switched from a fighting game to a beat &apos;em up and the title was changed following the success of Double Dragon. Final Fight was ported to various home consoles such as the SNES and was followed by a few sequels. Its development team later worked on the original Street Fighter II and some of the characters from Final Fight later appeared as playable fighters in other entries of the franchise such as the Street Fighter Alpha sub-series.</desc>

    <desc>The pioneers that brought you the award-winning PLAYSTATION Network title flOw are back with another concept that challenges traditional gaming conventions. Flower expands the team&apos;s tradition of delivering simple gameplay, accessible controls and a medium to explore emotional chords uncommon in video games. In Flower, the surrounding environment, most often pushed to the background in games, is pulled to the forefront and becomes the primary &quot;character.&quot; The player fades from an external and stressful world in the opening of this fresh and genuine game only for PS3, and journeys through beautifully vivid landscapes, changing the his surroundings and exploring nature along the way.

Playing as the wind, the player guides and grows a swarm of pedals by interacting with other flowers and the surrounding environment. The goals and journey in each level vary, but all involve flight, exploration and interaction with the level. Using simple SIXAXIS wireless controls, the player guides the lead petal and accumulates a swarm of flower petals as he moves at his own pace within the environment, causing the on-screen world to change. Flower&apos;s gameplay offers different experiences, pacing and rhythm to all players. Along the way, the environment will pose challenges to the player&apos;s progress.

Both pastoral and at times chaotic, Flower is a visual, audio and interactive escape on PS3.</desc>

    <desc>G-Force is a licensed game based on the movie of the same name. The player takes the control of Darwin who is member of a secret government organization consisting of guinea pigs. His mission: defending the evil industrial magnate Saber who manipulates home appliances and uses them as weapons. 

Not surprisingly these are the main foes in this game. But Darwin is not even close to helpless: various guns and gadgets, e.g. a jet pack, a electronic whip or a grappling hook, are used to dispatch of them. Most of the time is spent in fights but there are also puzzles. Many of them require the usage of Mooch, a fly. It can be summoned at any time and is able to reach high grounds, to deactivate electronic devices, to fly through small holes and even to slow down time to pass through fast moving obstacles.</desc>

It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you&apos;re a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you&apos;ll earn even more points! Or you could just give Steam Workshop a spin and create your own goats, levels, missions, and more! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.

Disclaimer: Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.</desc>

Reigniting the Great War, Kratos ascends Mount Olympus with his initial allies, the Titans, until he is abandoned by Gaia. Now guided by the spirit of Athena to search for the Flame of Olympus, Kratos battles monsters, gods, and Titans in a search for Pandora, the key to pacifying the Flame surrounding Pandora&apos;s Box, and to defeat Zeus. Successful, Kratos kills Zeus and ends the reign of the Olympian God</desc>

    <desc>GoldenEye 007 is a 2010 first-person shooter video game developed by Eurocom and published by Activision for the Wii video game console,[1] with a handheld version for Nintendo DS developed by n-Space.[4] It is a modern reimagining of the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye, and a remake of the 1997 Nintendo 64 video game GoldenEye 007. The game was officially announced by Nintendo at their E3 2010 conference presentation.[5] The game was released on 2 November 2010 in tandem with another James Bond game, Blood Stone. It took on the elements of a modern shooter while retaining a classic name. A remastering of the Wii game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in 2011, re-titled as GoldenEye 007: Reloaded.</desc>

    <desc>Green Day: Rock Band is a music video game developed by Harmonix, published by MTV Games and distributed by Electronic Arts. It is the fifth major console release in the Rock Band music video game series and, like other games in the series, it allows players to simulate the playing of rock music by using controllers shaped like musical instruments.

The game&apos;s setlist consists of songs by the American punk rock band Green Day. Green Day: Rock Band features virtual depictions of the three band members performing the songs in new venues designed for the game. The game incorporates existing Green Day songs already released for the Rock Band series as downloadable content, and allows players to export its full tracklist to the other Rock Band game titles except The Beatles: Rock Band.

A free playable demo for the game was made available on May 25, 2010 for the Xbox Live Marketplace and on May 27, 2010 for the PlayStation Network. The demo features full, playable versions of two songs from the game, &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; and &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;.</desc>

    <desc>Guitar Hero 5 (initially referred to as Guitar Hero V) is a music rhythm game and the fifth main entry in the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.

Guitar Hero 5&apos;s track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.

The game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game&apos;s menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour&apos;s sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer m</desc>

    <desc>Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is a music rhythm game developed by Neversoft, published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane. It was released on the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 consoles, with Budcat Creations solely developing the PlayStation 2 port, Vicarious Visions solely developing the Wii port, and Aspyr Media solely publishing the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X ports. The game was released on June 26, 2008 in Europe, on June 29, 2008 in North America, August 6, 2008 in Australia and October 9, 2008 in Japan. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith sold as both a bundle with a specially designed guitar controller as well as a game-only package.

The game is considered an expansion in the Guitar Hero series, extending upon the general features of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. As with other games in the series, the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of rock music by playing in-time to scrolling notes on-screen. It is the first game in the series to primarily focus on the work of one rock band, with Aerosmith songs comprising approximately 70% of the soundtrack, while the remaining songs are from bands that have been influenced by or opened for Aerosmith. The single player Career mode allows the player to follow the history of the band through several real-world-inspired venues, interspersed with interviews from the band members about their past. Aerosmith re-recorded four songs for this game, and have participated in a motion capture session to create their in-game appearances. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is the final installment of the series to only feature guitar and bass as possible instrument choices. The next entry (Guitar Hero World Tour) would introduce other roles to create a full band experience.

While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith maintains the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, it has received criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point; furthermore, with the game&apos;s strong focus on one band, reviewers felt that the game&apos;s ultimate enjoyment rested on the player&apos;s appreciation for the music of Aerosmith.</desc>

    <desc>&quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; with musical icons Metallica and over 20 other rocking acts in Guitar Hero: Metallica.

Just as Guitar Hero: Aerosmith was something of a glorified expansion of Guitar Hero III, Guitar Hero: Metallica serves as an extension of Activision&apos;s band-focused hit Guitar Hero: World Tour, offering gamers a feel for life in and around one of heavy metal&apos;s most popular and influential bands. The game features a total of 49 songs, including 28 original Metallica tracks, such as &quot;Seek and Destroy,&quot; &quot;Fade to Black,&quot; &quot;Master of Puppets,&quot; and &quot;One,&quot; and 21 band-selected songs from such acts as Bob Seger, Judas Priest, Queen, and Thin Lizzy. In general, the game&apos;s difficulty level was designed to be on par with that of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, however, the hard-hitting nature of some of Metallica&apos;s tracks led to the creation of an extremely difficult &quot;Expert+&quot; mode that can incorporate a second drum pedal.

Though band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo participated in motion-capture sessions to help create lifelike in-game avatars, the story actually finds players in the shoes of a band serving as Metallica&apos;s opening act. This narrative mechanic sends gamers to such real-world music venues as the Stone nightclub in San Francisco, the Forum in Los Angeles, the Hammersmith Odeon in London, and the Tushino Airfield in Russia. As always, players must earn high scores and unlock new songs by rhythmically matching onscreen prompts that correspond with musical notes. The music creation aspect of World Tour returns in Guitar Hero: Metallica, with new musical tones based on Hetfield&apos;s guitar and a new &quot;Drum Over&quot; mode that lets gamers play improvised drum tracks over any song, while the multiplayer &quot;Battle Mode&quot; comes equipped with new Metallica-themed power-ups such as &quot;Fade to Black,&quot; &quot;Ride the Lightning,&quot; and &quot;Trapped Under Ice.&quot;</desc>

    <desc>Guitar Hero Smash Hits (titled Guitar Hero Greatest Hits in Europe and Australia) is a music rhythm game and the fourth expansion game to the Guitar Hero series. The game features 48 songs originally featured in five previous games in the series—Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and Guitar Hero: Aerosmith—redesigning the songs to be based on master recordings and to include support for full band play first introduced to the series in Guitar Hero World Tour. The game was developed by Beenox, published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane for release on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 systems and was released around the world in the second half of June 2009.

The game reuses many elements from previous titles in the series, including Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero: Metallica. Beenox designed the game around playing the greatest songs of the series at venues located in the greatest places on Earth, and created venues based on various Wonders of the World for the game. While the game&apos;s soundtrack and expansion into a four-player band were well received by reviewers, the game was highly criticized for being a full-cost standalone title instead of being downloadable content for existing games in the series.</desc>

    <desc>The core game and story for both Ico (2001) and Shadow of the Colossus (2005) remains unchanged with the remastered versions. For the remastering, both games have had a graphics overhaul to allow them to support modern high-definition displays up to 1080p. With the more powerful PlayStation 3, both games feature a fixed frame rate of 30 frames per second; the original PlayStation 2 version of Shadow was noted for pushing the limits of the older console and often suffered from framerate losses.[6] Both games support stereoscopic 3D, taking advantage of the original design of the games with considerations towards depth-of-field viewing as evidenced by the large landscapes.[7] Both games in the collection support 7.1 surround sound.[8]

Ico&apos;s remastering is based on the European version, which features additional content that did not make it into the North America release of the original game, as well as some altered puzzles from these original releases. Specifically, upon completing of the game, the player can restart the game to see the English translations of the mysterious language that Yorda, the player-character&apos;s companion, uses, and a two-player mode with the second player in control of Yorda.[9] Though there was consideration for inclusion of PlayStation Move motion control support,[10] the final game does not ship with it.

The collection includes bonus content, including two XMB Dynamic Themes and exclusive video content for Ico, Shadow of the Colossus and Team Ico&apos;s upcoming game The Last Guardian.</desc>

    <desc>Use the Prince&apos;s katamari to roll up everyday objects in each level. The more objects that the Prince rolls up, the larger his katamari becomes, allowing him to roll up bigger items. The Prince faces his toughest challenge ever as Katamari Forever boasts the largest collection of stages, modes, songs, and cousins to date. Remixed classic Katamari Damacy tunes, a brand-new storyline, multiple new visual effects and 1080p graphics round out Katamari Forever into the ultimate Katamari experience ever.

A terrible event has occurred causing the stars to disappear from the night sky and the King of All Cosmos to fall into a coma. The Prince must use his finely tuned Katamari rolling skills once more to re-create the absent celestial bodies, save his royal father and restore order to the Cosmos. Thumb tacks, sushi, cats, people, skyscrapers, ocean liners and continents - nothing is safe as the Prince makes his way through the largest variety of stages in a single Katamari game ever. New graphical styles give Katamari Forever a certain &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot; that all new Katamari games possess. A few of the new styles include Wood, which uses warm sepia tones to give stages a wooden feel, while Comic creates thick black outlines on every object while filling them in with deep, rich colors. Make sure to try them all out and find your favorite for a totally new way to experience the world of Katamari.

In addition to all these great new features, Katamari Forever also contains local cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. Choose your favorite cousin and play together or compete in heated Katamari competition. Who will become the Katamari champion in your house?</desc>

    <desc>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 ReMIX includes...

KINGDOM HEARTS: FINAL MIX
In the original and Final Mix versions of Kingdom Hearts, the command menu had four commands: Attack, Magic, Items, and a fourth context-sensitive slot that varied depending on what the player had targeted, where they were, etc. The command menu has been updated to include &quot;Attack&quot;, &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Items&quot;, and &quot;Summons&quot; in the fourth slot, which was originally located as a sub-category beneath the &quot;Magic&quot; menu. The original fourth command has been replaced by the introduction of Reaction Commands from Kingdom Hearts II and are triggered by pressing the Triangle Button. The camera works more similarly to that of Kingdom Hearts II, utilizing the right thumb stick to move the camera and allowing the player to click the R3 button to reset the camera behind Sora, as opposed to the original game which made use of the shoulder triggers L2 and R2 to position the camera. Overall, the gameplay of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was modified so it would play more similarly to Kingdom Hearts II and Re:Chain of Memories, to create a more consistent play style throughout the series.

KINGDOM HEARTS: RE:CHAIN OF MEMORIES
This version of Chain of Memories was released in Europe and Australia for the first time as part of the collection, as it was previously released in North America in December 2008.

KINGDOM HEARTS: 358/2 DAYS
This game, originally released for the Nintendo DS, does not appear in playable form in this collection, and is instead adapted into 2 hours and 50 minutes worth of cinematic cutscenes, remastered in high definition.</desc>

    <desc>In a scenario drawn from the film, The LEGO Movie Videogame puts you into the role of Emmet, an ordinary, rules-following, perfectly average LEGO minifigure who is mistakenly identified as the most extraordinary person--and the key to saving the world. Guide him as he is drafted into a fellowship of strangers on an epic quest to stop an evil tyrant, a journey for which Emmet is hopelessly and hilariously underprepared.

In The LEGO Movie Videogame you will be able to collect and use LEGO instruction pages to build construction sets or harness the awesome power of the Master Builders to virtually build extraordinary LEGO creations along the way. With more than 90 characters inspired by the film and 15 exciting levels, you can build and adventure like never before.</desc>

    <desc>Lego Rock Band is a music video game, part of the Rock Band series developed by Harmonix, that incorporates elements from Lego video games developed by Traveller&apos;s Tales. The game is published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and MTV Games. The game was released on November 3, 2009 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii home consoles in the United States.[1] A Nintendo DS version was also developed in conjunction with Backbone Entertainment.

The game, as with other games in the Rock Band series, allows up to four players to use instrument controllers to play lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals on a number of rock music songs. In addition, aspects of building with Lego bricks are incorporated into the game, allowing players to customize their avatars and other band assistants, and include additional Lego-themed gameplay modes. The gameplay and the game&apos;s 45-song soundtrack has been selected to create a &quot;family-friendly&quot; game. Players are able to export the songs from the game into other Rock Band titles, while downloadable content that passes family-friendly filters can be incorporated into the game; however, songs released after Rock Band 3 are not compatible due to changes in the song format.[2]

Lego Rock Band was met with moderate reviews, which praised the inclusion of both the Rock Band and Lego video game aspects incorporated into the game, but questioned some selections on the game&apos;s soundtrack and some features that would be at odds with the target audience of the game.</desc>

    <desc>Mass Effect is set in the year 2183 AD. Thirty-five years prior, humankind discovered a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by a technologically advanced but long-extinct race called the Protheans. Studying and adapting this technology, humanity has managed to break free of the solar system and has established numerous colonies and encountered various extraterrestrial species within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing alien artifacts known as Mass Relays, the various space-faring races are able to travel instantly across vast stretches of the galaxy. Within the game, humanity has formed the Human Systems Alliance, one of many independent bodies that make up the collective of &quot;Citadel space&quot;. The Human Systems Alliance is a rising power in the galactic stage. The only war they have participated in was the &quot;First Contact War&quot; in 2157. A human exploration expedition was activating dormant mass relays (which was a practice considered unsafe by citadel races). The turians attacked the small fleet and proceeded to capture the closest human world, Shanxi. The turians proceeded to starve out the remaining humans and occupy the planet. Facing starvation the human garrison surrendered to the Turian Hierarchy. One month later, the human Second Fleet responded by annihilating the turian fleet around Shanxi. In response the turians prepared for full scale war. The citadel council saw that humanity would either be annihilated or annexed by the turians and stepped in. The humans were then given an embassy in the Citadel Council. Citadel space, as a whole, is ruled by a body of government known as the Council, which is made up of members of the three prominent alien races: the asari, a race of mono-gendered aliens which closely resemble blue-skinned human females; the short-lived salarians; and the raptor-like turians. Other alien species seen in the game include the reptilian krogan, the four-eyed, humanoid batarians, the aquatic hanar, and the methodical and quadrupedal elcor, and the environmental-suited quarians and volus. Dozens of other aliens are asserted to exist throughout the galaxy, but are not seen or mentioned in the game. The game takes place primarily in two locations: the prototype frigate SSV Normandy, and the Citadel, a gigantic, ancient space station purportedly built by the Protheans and which currently acts as the center of galactic civilization. Throughout the game, however, the player may navigate the Normandy to various planets, moons and oth</desc>

    <desc>Metal Gear Solid 4 is set in 2014, five years after the Big Shell incident and nine years after Shadow Moses incident. The world economy relies on continuous war, fought by PMCs, which outnumber government military forces. PMC soldiers are outfitted with nanomachines to enhance their abilities and control the stress on the battlefield. The control network created through these nanomachines is called Sons of the Patriots (SOP), and Liquid Ocelot is preparing to hijack the system. Snake accepts a request from Roy Campbell to terminate Liquid, with Otacon and Sunny providing mission support from the Nomad aircraft.</desc>

    <desc>After enjoying chart-topping success on Wii, Ubisoft&apos;s Michael Jackson: The Experience moonwalks over to the motion-sensing Kinect and PlayStation Move peripherals. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions offer ability to sing as well as dance, allowing users to create the complete concert experience. Other key features are specific to each platform. PlayStation Move owners, for example, can automatically post their performance progress and even pictures of themselves to Facebook. Features will scale based on the type of equipment detected, so players with microphones and not the PlayStation Move can still sing along to the music. Like the Kinect version, the PlayStation Move lets players view themselves on the screen along with the dancers. In addition to the soundtrack from the Wii version, the PlayStation 3 game includes a number of exclusive tracks, from &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot; to &quot;I Just Can&apos;t Stop Loving You.&quot;</desc>

    <desc>Mighty No. 9 is focused on 2D platforming, with a blend of 2D and 3D artwork and animation. Players control a robot named Beck, who is able to run, jump, and shoot projectiles at enemies he encounters. Furthermore, the player will be able to acquire both weapons and abilities from enemies they defeat. The game will feature an intro level followed by the eight main stages, which are freely chosen in any order by the player. At the end of each stage, Beck must face one of the other eight &quot;Mighty&quot; units in a boss battle. A final set of stages are unlocked at the end of the game, leading up to the final showdown. An additional level starring Beck&apos;s partner, Call, is also available at some point.

In addition to jumping and shooting, Beck&apos;s main ability is a dash, which can be used to move quickly and cross large gaps. Upon weakening enemies by shooting them, Beck can dash through them in order to absorb a substance known as Xel (pronounced &quot;Cel&quot;). Absorbing Xel from enemies will grant Beck temporary enhancements, such as increased power or speed. By defeating bosses, Beck can obtain new transformation forms, giving him new abilities such as magnetic limbs. Conversely, Call can&apos;t absorb Xel but can dash further than Beck and can use a shield that reflects projectiles and jetboots that slow her fall.</desc>

    <desc>NBA Jam is a basketball video game developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports. It is the latest installment in the NBA Jam video game franchise and it was released on October 5, 2010.[1] The game was initially planned to be available as a full retail release for the Wii, with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions available for download via a coupon upon purchasing NBA Elite 11. However, on September 28, 2010, EA announced that Elite would be delayed.[4] The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions were released as standalone titles on November 17, 2010.[5]

The game has a unique visual style, using 3D models with high-resolution photographs for the heads of each of the players. Several aspects such as the outrageous slam dunks and the ball catching on fire return from the original games.[6][7] Original NBA Jam creator Mark Turmell is serving as a consultant.[8] Tim Kitzrow, the announcer from the original NBA Jam also returns, re-recording all the lines from previous NBA Jam titles. All NBA Rosters are accurate as of April 7, 2010. The iOS version of the game is also available for OS X through the Mac version of the App Store, making it the only official computer version of the game.</desc>

    <desc>Need for Speed: ProStreet is the eleventh installment of Electronic Arts&apos; popular racing game series Need for Speed. On May 21, 2007, Electronic Arts published a teaser trailer of ProStreet, and officially announced it ten days later.[3] It was released worldwide in November 2007.[1] ProStreet includes more than 40 cars including a few from American Le Mans Series. ProStreet was the first PlayStation 3 game with DualShock 3 rumble support.

The demo, featuring two races, one speed challenge and one grip race, appeared on Xbox Live on October 26, 2007, on PlayStation Store on November 1, 2007, and on PC on November 2, 2007. The PC version is the last in the series to use CD-ROMs, which are succeeded by the usage of DVDs for the rest of the series.

    <desc>Unlike other games in the Ape Escape series, the game is an on-rails shooting game rather than a platformer. Players view the game from a first-person perspective with the motion controller acting as a gadget on-screen which include a floating net, a slingshot and a harisen. Players cycle through their arsenal using the Move button while either pressing the trigger button or performing gestures to utilize the gadget. For example, players swing the net to catch monkeys, press the trigger button to fire slingshots and wave the controller to use the fan.</desc>

    <desc>Portal 2 is a 2011 first-person puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts while online distribution of the Windows, OS X and Linux versions is handled by Valve&apos;s content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Before the game&apos;s release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.

The game retains Portal‍ &apos;​s gameplay elements, and adds new features, including tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like &apos;gels&apos; accelerating the player&apos;s speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or place portals on any surface. These gels were created by the team from the Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of Paint. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell, awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.

Although some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode.

    <desc>Prince of Persia is an action-adventure and platforming video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is part of the Prince of Persia franchise. The game was released in the United States on December 2, 2008 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and on December 9, 2008 for Microsoft Windows. It was later released on March 24, 2009 for Mac OS X via the Cider engine.

The game is set in ancient Persia, with a player-character whose name is not revealed in the game. He is accompanied by a woman named Elika, whom he met after a large sandstorm diverted him from his course and he ended up in a mysterious land. Players traverse many different environments using his acrobatic abilities to scale walls and even crawl on the ceilings. Throughout the journey, players combat various enemies as they attempt to cleanse the land of corruption. The game&apos;s storyline and setting borrowed some aspects from Zoroastrianism.[5]</desc>

    <desc>In the first-person puzzle platformer Quantum Conundrum , players must use the unusual ability to shift dimensions to navigate the twisting corridors of Quadwrangle Manor. Players take on the role of a young kid dropped off on his uncle&apos;s doorstep for the weekend; his uncle just so happens to be the brilliant, eccentric inventor, Professor Fitz Quadwrangle. Upon entering the Professor&apos;s vast manor home retrofitted with crazy technology to test his latest hypotheses, players quickly realize their uncle has gone missing. Fortunately, players soon gain access to Professor Quadwrangle&apos;s latest invention, the Inter-Dimensional Shift Device, which, at the press of a button, will shift the world around them to an entirely new dimension. In order to find him, players must use the newly found IDS Device to dynamically change the world to and from a variety of different dimensions to progress through the complicated Quadwrangle Manor. While on the journey, becoming adept at utilizing the various dimensions will help them trek from one bizarre and challenging room to the next. It might sound easy enough, but it is a tall order for a kid in a giant puzzle of a manor!</desc>

    <desc>Rango: The Video Game is a video game by Paramount Digital Entertainment, released on March 1, 2011. It is based on the film of the same name. The game is available for PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 as well as Nintendo DS. It was developed by Behaviour Interactive.

Beans&apos;s father sees a meteorite crash. The old soldier goes up the sandy hill, examines, and in a flash of green light offscreen, he is taken.

15 years later, Rango, the 17-year-old Western Chameleon from the film, enters the scene, passed out. He wakes up and makes his way into the Gas Can Saloon. Just then Slim walks in with parts of the rock, and Rango opens it, vaporizing him. Explaining the plotline of how he first saw the rocks, he says that Bad Bill was involved. He teamed up with the Jenkins cousins in an unnatural alliance. Rango tracks down Bill at the barber shop, their hideout.

Rango blows up the barber shop, and Bill escapes, but not before Rango gets one of the rocks.</desc>

    <desc>Get ready for a galactic adventure filled with explosive mayhem as the Ratchet &amp; Clank series makes its PS3 debut. Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction marks the beginning of a brand-new series of next-generation games for our gadget-building hero, Ratchet, and his brainy robotic sidekick, Clank.

After saving countless planets from dreadful doom and earning intergalactic mega-celebrity status in the process, Ratchet and Clank have taken some well-deserved R&amp;R -- again. Yet, Ratchet remains restless. An orphan of the universe, he has never known anything of his past, his family, or his Lombax origins. And no one, not even Clank, can fill that void. Unfortunately for Ratchet, someone else is equally interested in Ratchet&apos;s origins: Emperor Percival Tachyon. In his thirst for revenge, the vile tyrant of an ancient race of foul insect-like monsters called Cragmites has festered an age-old grudge and is bent on wiping the last-known Lombax off the universe!</desc>

    <desc>Ridge Racer 7 is the seventh console installment in the Ridge Racer series of racing games, released on PlayStation 3. The game has around 40 cars, many of which return from Ridge Racer 6 and the PSP incarnations of the game. There are also 22 courses, available in forward, reverse and mirror mode. The game runs at 1080p resolution and at 60 frames per second. It also features Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and free online gameplay via the PlayStation Network.

The game was first unveiled at the 2006 E3 event in a teaser trailer, and the first trailer of game footage was shown at the 2006 Tokyo Game Show.

Like many other games in the series, it features a full motion video opening that stars Reiko Nagase.

The game has since been re-issued under Sony&apos;s &quot;Platinum&quot; and &quot;The Best&quot; budget lines.

A patch was made available in October 2010 titled &quot;Ridge Racer 7 3D License Version&quot; that enables Ridge Racer 7 to be played in 3D.</desc>

    <desc>Rock Band Track Packs (called Song Packs in Europe and Australia)[1] are a series of supplemental media discs for the Rock Band series of music video games. The packs are developed by Harmonix and Demiurge Studios (earlier packs were developed with Pi Studios), and distributed by MTV Games and Electronic Arts. Harmonix has announced they will release additional discs, containing new songs not in past releases, and have not previously been made available through downloadable content. The track packs are fully functional stand alone games and do not require separate Rock Band titles to play;[2] however, on consoles that support downloadable content, the songs from these packs can be integrated with other Rock Band titles.</desc>

    <desc>Rock Band Track Pack: Metal is a standalone software product that allows owners of Rock Band and Rock Band 2 to keep on rocking with more hit songs from the pantheon of rock music. In addition, Rock Band Track Pack: Metal, like all Rock Band software, is compatible with all Rock Band instrument controllers and other current music-based video game peripherals.

Summoning power from the metal gods on high, the Rock Band team has assembled 20 on-disc tracks exploding with bone-crushing, ear-lashing, face-melting metal including anvil-heavy cuts from Godsmack, Children of Bodom, Evile, Judas Priest, Bullet For My Valentine and more! Six of the on disc tracks are brand new to the Rock Band platform via this package. (Fans who buy the Rock Band Metal Track Pack can play directly from the disc or download the songs onto their consoles&apos; hard drives through a free online offer -- once downloaded, the songs will automatically appear in the player&apos;s custom Rock Band library and can be integrated into setlists and played in all game modes of various Rock Band editions.)</desc>

    <desc>Players will use a guitar or drum peripheral to control the game. Two players can play what is called a &quot;competitive co-op&quot; throughout the entire game

Players will take on the role of the main character (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) who has the ability to defeat enemies (often zombies) with the power of rock as he searches for his love interest, voiced by Felicia Day. Players have a few weapons at their disposal (including a shield and blast power-up), but the player can only use these by strumming the correct colored fret buttons in order on their guitar controller. The developers will have bands record rock versions of classical music.[2]</desc>

    <desc>Rock Revolution is a music video game developed by Zoë Mode and HB Studios and published by Konami. It was first revealed on May 15, 2008, and released on October 15, 2008 for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360. As with similar titles, the game uses various controllers to simulate the performance of rock music, primarily using guitar and drum controllers on its Xbox 360 and PS3 versions.

Rock Revolution received generally negative reviews from critics, who felt that the game was merely an inferior clone of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises with no distinguishing characteristics to set it apart from its competition; particularly the design of its drum kit controller, the game&apos;s interface, and its soundtrack of mostly cover versions as its worst aspects. The game also experienced low sales numbers in its first month, selling only around 3,000 copies.</desc>

    <desc>Lead a five-person squad on a mission to neutralize those responsible for the elimination of a NATO Special Forces team in this continuation of Sony&apos;s squad-based shooter series. Fourteen single-player missions are part of a six-day battle in Southeast Asia, with an enemy AI designed to follow authentic squad tactics in response to your decisions on the battlefield. Issue orders to your fellow soldiers with a context-based command system, while calling for the support of UAV surveillance drones and aerial strikes when needed.

Utilize cover to protect your squad from attacks as you attempt to take out the enemy&apos;s defensive positions with explosive devices and heavy munitions. As you progress, you&apos;ll be able to expand your offensive arsenal by collecting the weapons from fallen foes. In addition to the single-player campaign, SOCOM 4 also includes competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. Both the PlayStation Move and traditional Dual Shock controllers are supported as well.</desc>

    <desc>The game features levels derived from 20 years of Sonic history, spreading across three eras: Classic, Dreamcast and Modern, which are played as either Classic Sonic or Modern Sonic. Classic Sonic&apos;s levels are strictly two dimensional side scrolling stages, using classic moves like the Spin Attack and Spin Dash, while Modern Sonic&apos;s levels follow the 2D/3D style gameplay of Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors, featuring techniques such as boosting and homing attacks. As well as classic power-ups such as Invincibility and Speed Shoes, certain levels have unique power-ups, such as skateboards in City Escape and Wisp powers in Planet Wisp.</desc>

    <desc>Tekken 6 features bigger stages with more interactivity than its predecessors, such as walls or floors that can be broken to reveal new fighting areas. The character customization feature has been enhanced, and certain items have implications in some aspects of gameplay.
A new &quot;rage&quot; system has been added, giving characters more damage per hit when their vitality is below a certain point. Once activated, a reddish energy aura appears around the character, and their health bar starts to flicker in red. The rage aura can be customized with different colors and effects to appear like fire, electricity, ice, among others. Another gameplay feature added is the &quot;bound&quot; system. Every character has several moves that, when used on an opponent that is currently midair in a juggle combo, will cause the opponent to be smashed hard into the ground, bouncing them off the floor in a stunned state and leaving them vulnerable to another combo or additional attack. As of the Bloodline Rebellion update, successfully parrying a low attack will also put a character into a bound state.</desc>

    <desc>Tomb Raider: Underworld is an action-adventure video game, the eighth instalment of the Tomb Raider series, following character Lara Croft. The story continues from the events in Tomb Raider: Legend as a direct sequel, but also addresses unexplained plot elements by association with Tomb Raider: Anniversary.[6] Underworld was released by Eidos Interactive for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows, in North America on 18 November 2008, Europe on 21 November 2008 and Australia on 5 December 2008. On 14 June 2012, Underworld was released on the Mac OS X by Feral Interactive.[7][8] It is the third game in the series to be developed by Crystal Dynamics and is also the first Tomb Raider game to be released on the PlayStation 3. Developers implemented new features into the gameplay, such as the dual-target feature and an upgraded inventory system, using an Active Sonar map and a multi-purpose grappling hook. The game also features a hint system and a new melee combat system where Lara has the ability to battle her opponents using kicks and grapple pulls. Downloadable content was also released exclusively for the Xbox 360, where the player takes control of Lara and her doppelgänger in two new chapters.

Underworld received mostly positive reviews for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC versions. Critics generally praised the environments, Lara&apos;s motion captured movements, story, puzzles, exploration, graphics and the less linear style of gameplay, although some criticism was directed at its &quot;haywire&quot; camera angles and &quot;dodgy&quot; combat system. The PlayStation 2 and Wii versions received mostly moderate to negative reviews. Most cited them as having medium to poor graphics; being oversimplified; &quot;dumbed&quot; down; and bugged, especially the PlayStation 2 version. On 27 February 2009, Eidos announced that the game had sold around 2.6 million copies worldwide.[9] On 22 May 2009, Tomb Raider: Underworld was re-released as part of the Xbox Classics and Platinum Range lines for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, respectively.[10] Underworld, along with Legend and Anniversary, was included in the The Tomb Raider Trilogy compilation, which was released in March 2011 for the PlayStation 3. In the end of 2011, Tomb Raider: Underworld was offered for free to PlayStation Plus members.[11]</desc>

    <desc>Ultra Street Fighter 4 includes Edition Select, which lets you pick from the various versions of the characters from all the games released in the Street Fighter 4 series.

At character select, you can pick the version of the fighter from SF4, SSF4, SSF4AE, SSF4 AE Ver. 2012 and Ultra Street Fighter 4.

This means, of course, that vanilla Sagat, who was nerfed by later versions of the game, can go up against the rebalanced characters from Ultra.

&quot;In all the years that I&apos;ve been playing through the SF4 series, I can&apos;t count how many times discussions on &apos;who the strongest character has been thus far&apos; have come up among players both old and new,&quot; Capcom&apos;s Peter Rosas, himself a former tournament player, wrote on Capcom Unity.

&quot;Seeing of how there was no actual way to measure whether vanilla SF4 Sagat was stronger than AE Yun, players would engage in long theoretical discussions with no way to figure out who was right. Well, time to change that in Ultra SF!&quot;

There are a couple of ways to get Ultra, due out in June on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in August on PC.

If you have Super Street Fighter 4 or Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition you can download Ultra Street Fighter 4 as a £10.99 / €14.99 / $14.99 digital upgrade for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in early June. The PC digital upgrade and the PC full digital bundle will both be available in August 2014.

Also in August the PS3 and Xbox 360 retail versions and full download version of the game will be released for £29.99 / €39.99 / $39.99. If you buy the PS3 or Xbox 360 retail version, or PS3, Xbox 360 or PC full digital bundle you get all previously-released costumes for the series.</desc>

    <desc>The WipEout HD Fury expansion pack increases the content of the acclaimed racing game with 8 new tracks, 13 new ship models and 3 new game modes, 2 of which will be available for online play! In addition there will be new trophies to attain, a re-styled front-end and a selection of new &amp; improved multiplayer functionality!

The Eliminator game mode will allow you to release all that pent-up aggression as you use the full arsenal of Wipeout weaponry to destroy your opponents. Forget those racing lines; this is all about destruction, with the victor being the first to reach the target score! Zone Battle is about risk and reward! Acceleration is automatic as you swoop over zone pads to fill your zone bar. Your choice is whether to use the bar to increase your speed and boost your ship ever closer to the target zone or absorb it to replenish vital lost energy. Warning, avoid the ‘zone barriers’, obstacles left on the track by your opponents as they boost towards the target zone, hitting these can literally destroy your hopes of victory! And finally, Detonator Mode introduces a brand new ship model to the game that will test both your piloting skills and your shooting accuracy as you accelerate through as many as 14 stages. Score points by destroying the mines that have been strewn along the track and take out the bomb on each stage to earn additional points. The more accurate you are the more points and bonuses you will score!</desc>

    <desc>-Blades is a hack-and-slash style action-adventure game in which the player must fight monsters, using a pair of gun blades and spells, through indoor and outdoor levels in order to progress. Monsters are encountered in both preset numbers and in areas with Monster Generators which spawn both standard and boss opponents until they are destroyed. Power-ups and coin fragments which grant different upgrades are hidden throughout the game. Power-ups include combat techniques, magic, weapon enhancements, and teleportation. Also earned throughout the game are experience points which can be converted into skills. These skills are of either &quot;light&quot; or &quot;dark&quot; alignment and the use of them has an effect on whether the player receives the &quot;light&quot; or &quot;dark&quot; ending.

The player will only achieve success in the game if they makes use of the extensive system for the further development of the heroine Ayumi – Experience Points earned, for example, must be converted to Skills. There are various Power-ups available to help the player as well, like combat techniques, magic, weapon enhancement and teleportation and the right mix will lead to success. Apart from that, the use of skills on the &quot;good or bad side&quot; also affects the finale. Depending on player actions, two different game endings await the heroine Ayumi – and that in itself is a hook for players.</desc>

    <desc>In YAIBA: NINJA GAIDEN Z, players will battle fierce zombies as Yaiba, a cyborg ninja who will do anything to get revenge and stay alive. Cleaved in two, he is brought back to life with cyber technology. Brandishing his ninja sword and the mecha weapons in his cyborg arm, he slaughters zombies with brutal, over the top abandon. Step into a stylized living comic book where stunning graphics depict a world gone mad. Hordes of undead can only be stopped by Yaiba&apos;s willingness to use any means necessary to get the job done. Will he kill by turning his cyborg arm into a razor chainsaw for slicing up undead or just rip off an opponent&apos;s arms to use as zombie nun chucks. Both possibilities fill Yaiba&apos;s heart with twisted laughter in this upcoming collaboration between famed developers Team NINJA and concept&apos;s Keiji Inafune.</desc>
