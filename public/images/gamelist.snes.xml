    <desc>ActRaiser was one of the early SNES games, drawing upon the success of side-scrolling platform action titles and the building model of Sim City. You play &quot;The Master&quot; (essentially God), and must save the world from evil.

First you purge the land by sending your spirit into a warrior with a big sword and magic powers. This side scrolling portion puts you in many different locales, from swamps and forests, to pyramids and snowy mountaintops.

As you eliminate evil from different parts of the land, you allow villagers to return and build their towns. You then control an angel who helps guide the villagers in their town building, and can send down miracles to aid them in their needs.</desc>

    <desc>Players control &quot;The Master,&quot; a god-like spirit sent down from the heavens, and fight to eradicate evil from the land. This sequel to ActRaiser focuses entirely on the side-scrolling action of the original, and has 14 levels with new monsters, new abilities, and new super powers.

You still control a &quot;Cloud Palace&quot; across a zoomable map of the world, choosing your next area of battle. In addition, many of the sound effects from the original game make their reappearance, as well as some hidden RPG elements.

Changes from the original ActRaiser include the elimination of the village-building mode, a move from a battery-save to password-save system, and a new musical score.</desc>

    <desc>Disney&apos;s Aladdin is based on the 1992 Disney animated film. For the GBA and the SNES editions development was handled by Capcom. Like other versions, the game is a side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Aladdin through locations from the movie like the city of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, and Jafar&apos;s palace. Some locations not appearing in the film include a trippy, candy-colored world inside the Genie&apos;s lamp and an ancient pyramid. Enemies standing in Aladdin&apos;s way include the Sultan&apos;s guards, animals and various magical creatures. They can be dispatched by jumping on top of them or by throwing apples at them. Besides jumping and throwing, another one of Aladdin&apos;s abilities consists of him pulling out a blanket and using it to slow his fall.

Besides the platform levels, the game also includes magic carpet rides as well as a bonus game played between levels: if Aladdin collects a golden scarab in a level, he can play a wheel of fortune for extra health, lives or continues.</desc>

    <desc>The kingdom of Kahna is in great danger. The evil Emperor Sauzer, obsessed by his world domination ideas, is preparing to invade the kingdom. The king sends his best troops of knights and wizards to face the enemy, but in vain - the kingdom is conquered by Sauzer, the king is murdered, and his lovely daughter is kidnapped. The brave leader of the Dragon Squad remembers the promise he gave the princess a long time ago: always be at her side. Supported by his friends and his faithful dragons, he must now free the princess and the kingdom from the enemy&apos;s hands. If only the strongest of the dragons, Bahamut, could be awakened...

Bahamut Lagoon is a tactical role-playing game. The player controls several parties of four characters each, and commands different dragons at once. The battles start on a top-down screen typical for strategy games, but often switch to a dynamic side view, such as often used in Japanese-style RPGs. The outcome of some battles can also be affected by other tactical decisions, such as, for example, setting a whole forest on fire to prevent enemies from coming through it.</desc>

    <desc>Based on the cartoon of the same name, Biker Mice From Mars is a racing game very similar to Rock &apos;n Roll Racing. Races are shown from an isometric perspective and you can choose between six different drivers that differ in acceleration, top speed and grip. During the races, you can use weapons such as mines or missiles to slow down your opponents and pick up random bonuses ranging from money to making you temporarily invincible. After each race, you will receive money that can be spent on better tires, armor, engines or weapons. There&apos;s also a two-player mode that lets you play the main race with a friend or compete in a one on one race.</desc>

    <desc>The planet Tuul was a peaceful place, until the evil warrior Sarlac used the power of the Darkstone to take control. Blackthorne&apos;s father, the good King Vlaros, sent him to Earth just as his kingdom crumbled around him. Now, twenty years later, Blackthorne is grown and must return to Tuul to free it from the clutches of Sarlac.

Blackthorne is a platform action game played from a side-view with non-scrolling backgrounds. It has certain similarities to Prince of Persia, being set in maze-like environments and focusing on exploration and occasional puzzle-solving. Blackthorne fights enemies by shooting at them. His default weapon, a pump action shotgun, can be upgraded throughout the course of the game. Various types of bombs can be used to damage enemies, blow open doors, or destroy generations. Keys must be often found to gain access to new areas.</desc>

    <desc>The game is based on the Disney TV show of the same name. Bonkers is a bob-cat police officer who lives in &quot;toondom&quot;, a cartoony land where people co-exist with various creatures from cartoon movies.

One day, Bonkers and his partner Lucky hear about a shocking robbery: Hollywood&apos;s most valuable treasures - Sorcerer&apos;s Hat, Mermaid&apos;s Voice, and Magic Lamp - were stolen! Now it is up to Bonkers to capture the thieves and to take back the stolen treasures.

This is an action platform game. Bonkers can jump and dash, throwing enemies aside and even destroying some obstacles. Enemies can be killed by jumping on their heads. You can also collect various items such as bombs to throw at the enemies, cakes to refill your health, or hyper juice to make you dash continuously.

Besides the common license, this game is totally different from the Genesis game Bonkers.</desc>

    <desc>A young man named Crono is about to enjoy a carefree day: he plans to go to the Millennial Fair, where his friend Lucca intends to demonstrate her newest scientific invention: a teleporter. Upon his arrival Crono meets a young girl named Marle, who volunteers to be the first to test Lucca&apos;s new device. However, Marle&apos;s pendant affects the teleporter&apos;s mechanism in a mysterious way, and as a result she is teleported four hundred years into the past. Crono and Lucca quickly recreate the time portal and follow Marle. They find out that her unexpected appearance has created some confusion, and proceed to fix the error, which in turn leads to unforeseen consequences, eventually compelling the heroes to travel to different time periods and change the history of the world.

Chrono Trigger is a Japanese-style role-playing game in which the player takes control of a party consisting of up to seven characters, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. There are no random encounters in the game: all the enemies are either visibly walking on the field maps and can be avoided by the player, or are waiting to ambush the party. No enemy encounters occur when the player navigates characters over the world map.

The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from Final Fantasy games as one of the combat style selections offered to the player in the beginning. The other selectable battle mechanic pauses combat whenever the player accesses the menu, effectively removing the real-time element and rendering the battles fully turn-based.

As the characters grow in power, their parameters increase, and they learn new &quot;techs&quot; - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them magic points to use in battle. Techs may target a specific formation of enemies (e.g. a line) and can be used tactically depending on the enemies&apos; positioning in combat. Characters may execute techs individually or perform double or triple techs, where each character contributes a tech which is combined with one or two others to unleash a powerful attack.

Once player-controlled characters acquire the ability to travel freely between time periods, the game&apos;s plot develops in a non-linear fashion. From that point on the player may opt to face the game&apos;s final adversary in combat and complete the story, or perform other plot-related quests. Depending on the moment of the story when the player decides to proceed to the final battle, the game may be concluded w</desc>

    <desc>The hideous Red Falcon, thought to have been destroyed long ago by the Earth&apos;s greatest commandos, Mad Dog and Scorpion, has risen again, this time very angry and thirsty for revenge. His armies are marching through the cities, across the lands, with the intention of exterminating the human race like a bad case of fleas. Two commandos, Jimbo and Sully, have come forth now to defeat Red Falcon and save what remains of the world from his hideous plans.

The Alien War is the third entry in the Contra series. Like its predecessors, it is a predominantly side-scrolling shooter with a heavy emphasis on action. The protagonist can carry two weapons (as opposed to one in the previous entries), and fire in eight directions when standing still. New abilities include climbing on walls, grabbing poles and navigating tanks. Parts of scenery can be destroyed.

In a few instances the protagonist will also participate in motorcycle changes. Two stages have a top-down view and are played differently than the side-scrolling levels, with more freedom of exploration and the necessity to complete mission objectives rather than simply advance in one direction and kill all the enemies.</desc>

    <desc>Demon&apos;s Crest is a sequel to Gargoyle&apos;s Quest. Once, the world of demons and the world of humans co-existed in harmony. But then six mysterious crests fell from the sky onto the earth, crests of six elements: fire, water, air, earth, time, and heaven. The demons became obsessed with the crests and with the power hidden in them, and so a civil war started. Finally, the Red Demon named Firebrand got all the crests but one - the crest of heaven. The Dragon Demon possessed this crest, so Firebrand decided to confront him. He defeated the Dragon Demon, but was himself severely wounded in battle. While flying back, he was knocked down by a mysterious enemy and lost his crests.

You control Firebrand, a flying red demon, and your mission is to help him to gain his crests, and to defeat everybody who stands in his way. This is a platform action game: you fight the enemies in real time (using magical attacks), avoid obstacles, collect healing potions on the way, etc. Firebrand can also fly for a short time.</desc>

    <desc>King K. Rool has stolen Donkey Kong&apos;s banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Queen B., and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy.

Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.

The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.

The original Super Nintendo game was later released for Nintendo&apos;s handheld systems. The Game Boy Color version has an exclusive level (Necky Nutmare) and additional bonus games, Funky&apos;s Fishing and five Crosshair Cranky minigames. There was also the addition of collectible DK sticker packs scattered throughout the levels. These sticker packs could be printed out using the Game Boy Printer. The game also has two more difficulty options that become available after beating the game.Beating the game once lets the player turn off DK barrels and beating the game a second time will let the player turn off checkpoint barrels.

The Game Boy Advance version also had additional bonus games. It to has a version of Funky&apos;s Fishing but instead of the crosshair themed games, there is now Candy&apos;s Dance Studio, which hosts six dance games. There is also the additions of a time attack mode called DK Attack, a harder difficulty mode called Hero Mode (can only play as Diddy Kong and the game no longer offers Donkey Kong barrels and checkpoints throughout the levels), and the sticker book idea from the Gameboy Color version was replaced with collecting scrapbook pictures instead.</desc>

    <desc>Donkey Kong has been &quot;kongnapped&quot; by the nasty K. Rool and the Kremlings, and it is up to Diddy Kong and his girl-friend Dixie Kong to save him.

All the familiar enemies and helpful friends return, along with some new characters, including the wise Wrinkly Kong who will teach you some important lessons in gameplay. Again the emphasis is on banana collecting, where as every one hundred bananas makes one extra life. Apart from beating K. Rool and rescuing Donkey Kong, there are extra missions that can be completed. Collect enough K. Rool Kremkoins to open up the routes to the Lost World, while every level has a hidden Hero Coin to collect.

The Game Boy Advance version also includes a bonus game mode with three minigames (Expresso&apos;s Racing, Funky&apos;s Flights, and Bag a Bug) plus a time attack mode called Diddy&apos;s Dash (complete levels as fast as possible as Diddy Kong). This version of the game also includes an additional boss (Kerozene) and two more collectibles (Golden Feathers that increase Expresso&apos;s stats in the Expresso&apos;s Racing bonus game and photographs that fill out a scrapbook). Due to the addition of the bonus games and the scrapbook 28 more Hero Coins were also added.</desc>

    <desc>The storyline of E.V.O.: Search for Eden follows the same patterns as modern Evolution theories. The players first controls a prehistoric sea organism, and fights to gain evolution points with which he can improve his fish&apos;s body parts and upgrade his attack/defense abilities. The gameplay is not completely linear, which means that certain choices of paths and stages will affect the player&apos;s success.

The game is composed of a series of stages, in which the sea organism slowly evolves into an amphibian, and later a land-only creature. The physical changes are fairly scientifically accurate which gives the game a semi-educational purpose as well.

E.V.O.: Search for Eden is based on the Japan-only computer game 46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinkaron. While the basic premise of the game is the same, there are significant changes in gameplay and the layout of the game world.

In the computer release, the battles against other creatures were turn-based; here, the combat is real time, which effectively turns this version into an action RPG. The stages, while retaining similar themes, have a completely different layout. Side-scrolling view prevails over the original&apos;s top-down perspective. There are also boss battles that were absent in the original version.

Character building (&quot;evolution&quot;) is also different. Instead of distributing evolution points into four parameters, the player now basically &quot;buys&quot; upgrades, which have a fixed &quot;price&quot;. The player is able to acquire such upgrades for the creature&apos;s body parts (jaws, neck, body, etc.), raising their parameters and becoming stronger.

Story elements, friendly characters (NPCs), and quest-based structure that characterized the original game have been reduced and/or omitted in this release.</desc>

    <desc>The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. However, the recent actions of the king make even the most loyal of his subordinates doubt his judgment. The captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to attack the city of Mysidia and take the Water Crystal from innocent magicians who protect it. When Cecil questions the king&apos;s orders, he is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to deliver a package to the village of Mist, accompanied by his best friend Kain, the captain of the dragoons. Little does he realize that the king&apos;s inexplicable behavior is but a part of a much larger picture, which he is yet to reveal.

The fourth entry in the Final Fantasy series was released as Final Fantasy II in the West, because the second and the third games were not released there at the time. The game is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down world map navigation, automatic leveling up, and random enemy encounters.

The game introduces a system called ATB (active-time battle). While combat is turn-based in its core, the game does not pause when the player accesses the battle menu. Enemies continue to act in real time regardless of the actions of the player-controlled party. The turns of the participants are calculated depending on their agility rating. Each player-controlled character has a special bar that gradually refills itself; said character may act when the bar is full.

Unlike all the previous Final Fantasy games, the fourth installment does not allow the player to customize the characters&apos; abilities and classes. Each character belongs to a specific, clearly defined class: dragoon, white mage, black mage, summoner, ninja, etc. Each of these classes has distinct special abilities or magic spells. New abilities are learned automatically when a character reaches a pre-determined level. Characters join and leave the party as dictated by the game&apos;s plot events. The active party includes up to five combatants.</desc>

    <desc>A thousand years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people have is the Empire, whose leaders are looking to revive the great force once known as &quot;magic&quot;.

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as &quot;Esper&quot;, being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that initiates a dangerous series of events. The only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, who offer their very hearts and souls to save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.

The sixth entry in the Final Fantasy series was dubbed Final Fantasy III in the West because three out of the five previous installments of the series had not been released there at the time. Similarly to its predecessors, this is a role-playing game where the player controls a party of characters, travelling between various locales in the world, fighting randomly appearing regular enemies and bosses, and making the characters stronger by improving their skills and getting better equipment for them. The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous installments in the series, spicing traditional turn-based combat engine with a real-time element.

In battle, every character can fight using weaponry and items, and each has a special combat skill as well. It is also possible for nearly every character to learn magic spells. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, the player can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells the characters should learn.

Unlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game does not have a single main character. Rather, the player-controlled party can be considered the game&apos;s collective protagonist. The first part of the game develops linearly, with one of the characters playing a central role; however, during the second part the player is associated with a different character initially, exploring the game world, recruiting characters, and completing sub-quests in a non-linear fashion.</desc>

    <desc>The SNES version of Final Fight some significant differences to the original: there is one less level (the factory level is gone), one less character to choose from (only Haggar and Cody are available) and no multiplayer. There is also a sprite restriction of three enemies at the same time in place.

There are also some minor differences such as different enemies (all female ones were replaced with males), different boss names (Damnd became Thrasher and Sodom became Katana), a removed power-up (Whiskey) and the outcry &quot;Oh My God!&quot; was changed to &quot;Oh My Car!&quot;.

The later released Final Fight Guy is essentially the same game, but the second playable character is Guy instead of Cody. There is also a small change in the intro: Guy says that Cody is still in Japan training his martial arts skills so it is up to him to save Jessica.</desc>

    <desc>Final Fight 3 is almost identical to the previous two SNES installments. The Mad Gear gang has been destroyed and, because of this, the Skull Cross gang has gone rampant in Metro City. Now, it is up to mayor Mike Haggar and Guy (along with newcomers Dean and Lucia) to stop them once and for all.

Like the previous games, this game is a side-scrolling fighting game similar in style to the Double Dragon and Streets of Rage series. In addition to using various punches, kicks, and special attacks, players can also pick up and use various melee weapons lying on the streets, such as bottles, lampposts, metal pipes, barrels, etc.</desc>
