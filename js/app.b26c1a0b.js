It was released worldwide for consoles, beginning in North America on August 25, 2009, with a Microsoft Windows version following on September 15.\\n\\nWritten by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini, Arkham Asylum is based on the long-running comic book mythos. In the game\'s main storyline, Batman\'s archenemy, the Joker, instigates an elaborate plot to seize control of Arkham Asylum and trap Batman inside with many of his incarcerated foes. With Joker threatening to detonate hidden bombs around fictional Gotham City, Batman is forced to fight his way through the asylum\'s inmates and put an end to the Joker\'s plans.

The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman\'s combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in combat and exploration.\\n\\nThe game received critical acclaim—particularly for its narrative—and won several awards, including Best Action Adventure game, Best Game, and Game of the Year from different media outlets.

The Beatles: Rock Band is the first band-centric game in the series, and it is centered on the popular English rock group the Beatles. The game features virtual portrayals of the four band members performing the songs throughout the band\'s history, including depictions of some of their famous live performances, as well as a number of \\"dreamscape\\" sequences for songs from the Abbey Road Studios recording sessions during the group\'s studio years. The game\'s soundtrack consists of 45 Beatles songs; additional songs and albums by the Beatles were made available for the game as downloadable content.[1]\\n\\nThe game was released internationally on 9 September 2009, coinciding with the release of new, remastered compact disc versions of the Beatles\' albums. It incorporates many of the gameplay features of the Rock Band series; however, it is not an expansion pack for the Rock Band series and content for it and other Rock Band titles is not cross-compatible. Harmonix co-founder Alex Rigopulos described the game as \\"... a new, full game title production built from the ground up.\\"[2] Gameplay mechanics differ slightly from previous Rock Band games, including the addition of a three-part vocal harmony system.

It is the first game in the series to primarily focus on the work of one rock band, with Aerosmith songs comprising approximately 70% of the soundtrack, while the remaining songs are from bands that have been influenced by or opened for Aerosmith. The single player Career mode allows the player to follow the history of the band through several real-world-inspired venues, interspersed with interviews from the band members about their past. Aerosmith re-recorded four songs for this game, and have participated in a motion capture session to create their in-game appearances. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is the final installment of the series to only feature guitar and bass as possible instrument choices. The next entry (Guitar Hero World Tour) would introduce other roles to create a full band experience.\\n\\nWhile Guitar Hero: Aerosmith maintains the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, it has received criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point; furthermore, with the game\'s strong focus on one band, reviewers felt that the game\'s ultimate enjoyment rested on the player\'s appreciation for the music of Aerosmith.","date":"20080629T000000","developer":"","publisher":"","genre":["Music"],"players":"","images":{"cover":"covers/BLUS30133.png","image":"screenshots/BLUS30133.png","marquee":""},"tags":["face"],"ps3":{"info":"/dev_ntfs/PS3ISO","id":"BLUS30133","file":"/mount_ps3/dev_hdd0/tmp/wmtmp/BLUS30133-[Guitar+Hero+Aerosmith].ntfs[PS3ISO]"}},{"id":"BLUS30257","name":"Guitar Hero: Metallica","video":"","rating":"","desc":"\\"Ride the Lightning\\" with musical icons Metallica and over 20 other rocking acts in Guitar Hero: Metallica.\\n\\nJust as Guitar Hero: Aerosmith was something of a glorified expansion of Guitar Hero III, Guitar Hero: Metallica serves as an extension of Activision\'s band-focused hit Guitar Hero: World Tour, offering gamers a feel for life in and around one of heavy metal\'s most popular and influential bands. The game features a total of 49 songs, including 28 original Metallica tracks, such as \\"Seek and Destroy,\\" \\"Fade to Black,\\" \\"Master of Puppets,\\" and \\"One,\\" and 21 band-selected songs from such acts as Bob Seger, Judas Priest, Queen, and Thin Lizzy. In general, the game\'s difficulty level was designed to be on par with that of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, however, the hard-hitting nature of some of Metallica\'s tracks led to the creation of an extremely difficult \\"Expert+\\" mode that can incorporate a second drum pedal.\\n\\nThough band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo participated in motion-capture sessions to help create lifelike in-game avatars, the story actually finds players in the shoes of a band serving as Metallica\'s opening act. This narrative mechanic sends gamers to such real-world music venues as the Stone nightclub in San Francisco, the Forum in Los Angeles, the Hammersmith Odeon in London, and the Tushino Airfield in Russia. As always, players must earn high scores and unlock new songs by rhythmically matching onscreen prompts that correspond with musical notes. The music creation aspect of World Tour returns in Guitar Hero: Metallica, with new musical tones based on Hetfield\'s guitar and a new \\"Drum Over\\" mode that lets gamers play improvised drum tracks over any song, while the multiplayer \\"Battle Mode\\" comes equipped with new Metallica-themed power-ups such as \\"Fade to Black,\\" \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" and \\"Trapped Under Ice.\\"","date":"20090329T000000","developer":"Neversoft Entertainment","publisher":"Activision","genre":["Life Simulation","Music"],"players":"4","images":{"cover":"covers/BLUS30257.png","image":"screenshots/BLUS30257.png","marquee":""},"tags":["face","memory"],"ps3":{"info":"/dev_ntfs/PS3ISO","id":"BLUS30257","file":"/mount_ps3/dev_hdd0/tmp/wmtmp/BLUS30257-[Guitar+Hero+Metallica].ntfs[PS3ISO]"}},{"id":"BLUS30290","name":"Guitar Hero: Smash Hits","video":"","rating":"","desc":"Guitar Hero Smash Hits (titled Guitar Hero Greatest Hits in Europe and Australia) is a music rhythm game and the fourth expansion game to the Guitar Hero series.

While the game\'s soundtrack and expansion into a four-player band were well received by reviewers, the game was highly criticized for being a full-cost standalone title instead of being downloadable content for existing games in the series.","date":"20090616T000000","developer":"","publisher":"","genre":[],"players":"","images":{"cover":"covers/BLUS30290.png","image":"screenshots/BLUS30290.png","marquee":""},"tags":["face"],"ps3":{"info":"/dev_ntfs/PS3ISO","id":"BLUS30290","file":"/mount_ps3/dev_hdd0/tmp/wmtmp/BLUS30290-[Guitar+Hero+Smash+Hits].ntfs[PS3ISO]"}},{"id":"BLUS30291","name":"Guitar Hero: Van Halen","video":"","rating":"","desc":"Guitar Hero: Van Halen lets you stand in the shoes of this Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band as you perform 25 epic Van Halen tracks, three signature Eddie Van Halen solos and 19 guest act tracks.

Thirty-five years prior, humankind discovered a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by a technologically advanced but long-extinct race called the Protheans. Studying and adapting this technology, humanity has managed to break free of the solar system and has established numerous colonies and encountered various extraterrestrial species within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing alien artifacts known as Mass Relays, the various space-faring races are able to travel instantly across vast stretches of the galaxy. Within the game, humanity has formed the Human Systems Alliance, one of many independent bodies that make up the collective of \\"Citadel space\\". The Human Systems Alliance is a rising power in the galactic stage. The only war they have participated in was the \\"First Contact War\\" in 2157. A human exploration expedition was activating dormant mass relays (which was a practice considered unsafe by citadel races). The turians attacked the small fleet and proceeded to capture the closest human world, Shanxi. The turians proceeded to starve out the remaining humans and occupy the planet. Facing starvation the human garrison surrendered to the Turian Hierarchy. One month later, the human Second Fleet responded by annihilating the turian fleet around Shanxi. In response the turians prepared for full scale war. The citadel council saw that humanity would either be annihilated or annexed by the turians and stepped in. The humans were then given an embassy in the Citadel Council. Citadel space, as a whole, is ruled by a body of government known as the Council, which is made up of members of the three prominent alien races: the asari, a race of mono-gendered aliens which closely resemble blue-skinned human females; the short-lived salarians; and the raptor-like turians. Other alien species seen in the game include the reptilian krogan, the four-eyed, humanoid batarians, the aquatic hanar, and the methodical and quadrupedal elcor, and the environmental-suited quarians and volus. Dozens of other aliens are asserted to exist throughout the galaxy, but are not seen or mentioned in the game. The game takes place primarily in two locations: the prototype frigate SSV Normandy, and the Citadel, a gigantic, ancient space station purportedly built by the Protheans and which currently acts as the center of galactic civilization.

The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts while online distribution of the Windows, OS X and Linux versions is handled by Valve\'s content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Before the game\'s release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.\\n\\nThe game retains Portal‍ \'​s gameplay elements, and adds new features, including tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like \'gels\' accelerating the player\'s speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or place portals on any surface. These gels were created by the team from the Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of Paint. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell, awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.\\n\\nAlthough some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor.
